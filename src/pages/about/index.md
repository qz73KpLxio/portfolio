Hey, I'm Samuel. I'm a Java developer at [Tegeria](https://tegeria.com). Since
childhood, I've loved problem-solving—taking gadgets apart, understanding their
mechanics, and putting them back together sparked my career goals. Now, as a
Java backend developer, I’ve honed critical thinking and developed strategies
for today's digital challenges. Outside of work, I enjoy basketball, adventures
with friends, and coding. Movies are also a big passion, inspiring me with their
storytelling and creativity.
